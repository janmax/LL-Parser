## LL_Parser

This tiny little script is not intended to serve any propose but to write some
code on a rainy weekend and learn a bit more about parsing stuff/grammar. Give
it an BNF as input string and it will output you a LL(1) parser for your
grammar.

#### TODO
* Make first sets a dictionary
* make table deterministic
* maybe some argparsing stuff would be nice

#### Dependencies

* texttable for parse table output
